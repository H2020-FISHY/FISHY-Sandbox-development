## FISHY-Sandbox Prerequisites

+ Three Virtual Machines (VM) using the “fishy-sandbox-baseline.qcow” image. Each VM must have at least 2CPUs and 2GBs of RAM for its execution.
+ All machines must be interconnected through a virtual network that provides Internet connectivity. Each VM must have one network interface connected to this virtual network
+ The deployment of each VM with a single network interface is recommended. If more interfaces are aggregated to the VM, the script will attach the NED to the interface used to reach the internet (i.e., the default route). Therefore, the VM must be able to reach the rest using this interface. 

<!--
## Kubernetes Cluster components

* Kubeadm: version 1.22
* Kubectl: version 1.22.2

## FISHY-Sandbox Components

Component | Fishy-Control-Services | Domain-1 | Domain-2 | IP Address(es) | Comments 
:-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |:-------------
K8s cluster | X | X | X |  | Kubeadm: version 1.22; Kubectl: version 1.22.2; Docker: version 20.10.3 
NED (v1)  | X | X | X | 192.168.5.251 (NED in FCS Domain); 192.168.5.252 (NED in Domain 1); 192.168.5.253 (NED in Domain 2) | Automatically deployed on each domain once the sandbox has been installed (see *installation process* below). This version supports two VLANs: one for management communication and a second one for inter-domain data-plane communications. 
IRO (v1)  | X |  |  | 192.168.5.1 | Automatically deployed on the Fishy-Control-Services domain once the sandbox has been installed. The current version supports one VLAN for management communication. Additional interfaces (e.g data) might follow in the future if needed.
Central Repository  | X |  |  | 192.168.5.2 | Automatically deployed on the Fishy-Control-Services domain once the sandbox has been installed. The current version supports one VLAN for management communication. Additional interfaces (e.g data) might follow in the future if needed.
Central Repository RabbitMQ  | X |  |  | dynamic | Automatically deployed on the Fishy-Control-Services domain once the sandbox has been installed. The current version is a k8s deployment not linked to a management interface. The environment variables "CENTRAL_REPOSITORY_RMQ_SERVICE_HOST" and "CENTRAL_REPOSITORY_RMQ_SERVICE_PORT" can be used to connect to it
